# Licence

## 1. PREAMBLE

I realise that licences might seem overarching, but it is necessary to provide one.

This project is for my own learning experience as I learn React, and perhaps it will help others to learn as well. Since this is an education project, the code may not be completely efficient or secure and may be subject to refactors and updates. Follow your own judgment as to whether or not to implement the code or parts of it.

## 2. USAGE

2.1 You may use the code for personal, non-profit and non-commercial projects.

2.2 Commercial or for profit use is not permitted.

2.3 Even though this is a personal project, if you do use the code, please attribute me by providing a link to this repository in your project code.

## 3. DISCALIMER

3.1 This code is provided asis and without any warranty and no guarantee to function or function as expected. As such, I am not liable for any loss or damage in any form to any person, entity or item resulting from downloading/cloning the code and running and/or deploying it on any device.

3.2 Ensure that you inspect the code before use to ensure it meets your requirements and expectations.
